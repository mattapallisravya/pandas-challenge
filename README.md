Pycity school analysis:

- Analysis was performed on various schools like district/public schools and charter schools to determine the overall trends in the school performance based on the factors such as budget allocated, school size , type of the school.

- Data contains 15 different schools with the overall students count of 39000.

District level analysis:

- calculations were made for the following and created high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.
    
        - Total number of unique schools

        - Total students

        - Total budget

        - Average math score

        - Average reading score

        - % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

        - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

        - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

School wise Analysis:

- Created a dataframe to show scores, budget per school, per student and the following after the necessary calculations were made 

        - School name

        - School type

        - Total students

        - Total school budget

        - Per student budget

        - Average math score

        - Average reading score

        - % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

        - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

        - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
        
- Also created the dataframes for following.
        
        - highest and lowest performing schools based on overall passing
        
        - Math scores by grade
        
        - Reading scores by grade
        
        - scores by school spending
        
        - scores by school size
        
        - scores by school type
        
PyCitySchool analysis report:

    - Based on the district summary percentage of students passed both math and reading(65.172326%) is low where as individual pass percentage is higher(Math - 74.980853%,    Reading-85.805463%). 
    
    - charter schools has less number of students compared to the public/district schools also the overall pass percentage is higher for charter schools.
    
    - Charter schools are in the list of top 5 schools based on the overall pass percentage, where as bottom 5 schools are district schools.
   
    - Schools with lesser budget per student(578$ to 630$ per student) outperformed the schools with higher budget per student(645$ to 675$ per student).
    
    - on a whole Percentage of students passed math is lesser than that of percentage of students passed reading. More focus has to be given to the math to increase overall pass percentage.
    
    - small and medium size schools secured higher scores in math and reading than that of large size schools. There is dramatic difference in math scores(89-91% passing vs 67%).
   
    - As a whole charter schools outperformed the public/district schools in all metrics. However, further analysis is required to determine if the effect is due to the school practices or student to teacher ratio or the number of students per school.
